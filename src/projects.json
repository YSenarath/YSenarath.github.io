        "description": "An Arduino based project to design an automation system to conserve electrical energy and to remote control electrical appliances like bulbs and fans. The system detects absence of people in room and automatically shuts down power to electrical devices connected. The sensors automatically detect entrance of people to room and light up bulbs depending on the time of the day. In order enhance the capabilities of the system an Android based application was developed to control connected appliances manually via a Bluetooth enabled Android smartphone. Developed as semester project for semester 2, CS 1962: Engineering Skill Development module. Received an ‘A’ grade at final project evaluation."
