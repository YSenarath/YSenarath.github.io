                Aspect Extraction from consumer reviews has become an essential factor for successful Aspect Based
                Sentiment Analysis. Typical user trends to mention his opinion against several aspects in a single
                review; therefore, aspect extraction has been tackled as a multi-label classification task. Due to its
                complexity and the variety across different domains, yet, no single system has been able to achieve
                comparable accuracy levels to the human-accuracy. However, novel neural network architectures and hybrid
                approaches have shown promising results for aspect extraction. (Support Vector Machines) SVMs and
                (Convolutional Neural Networks) CNNs pose a viable solution to the multi-label text classification task
                and has been successfully applied to identify aspects in reviews. In this paper, we first define an
                improved CNN architecture for aspect extraction which achieves comparable results against the current
                state-of-the-art systems. Then we propose a mixture of classifiers for aspect extraction, combining the
                proposed improved CNN with an SVM that uses the state-of-the-art manually engineered features. The
                combined system outperforms the results of individual systems while showing a significant improvement
                over the state-of-the-art aspect extraction systems that employ complex neural architectures such as
                MTNA.

                The purpose of text emotion analysis is to detect and recognize the classification of feeling expressed
                in text. In recent years, there has been an increase in text emotion analysis studies for English
                language since data were abundant. Due to the growth of social media large amount data are now available
                for regional languages such as Tamil and Sinhala as well. However, these languages lack necessary
                annotated corpus for many NLP tasks including emotion analysis. In this paper, we present our scalable
                semi-automatic approach to create an annotated corpus named ACTSEA for Tamil and Sinhala to support
                emotion analysis. Alongside, our analysis on a sample of the produced data and the useful findings are
                presented for the low resourced NLP community to benefit. For ACTSEA, data were gathered from twitter
                platform and annotated manually after cleaning. We collected 600280 (Tamil) and 318308 (Sinhala) tweets
                in total which makes our corpus largest data collection which is currently available for these
                languages.

                This paper describes an approach to solve implicit emotion classification with the use of pre-trained
                word embedding models to train multiple neural networks. The system described in this paper is composed
                of a sequential combination of Long Short-Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Network for feature
                extraction and Feedforward Neural Network for classification. In this paper, we successfully show that
                features extracted using multiple pre-trained embeddings can be used to improve the overall performance
                of the system with Emoji being one of the significant features. The evaluations show that our approach
                outperforms the baseline system by more than8% without using any external corpus or lexicon. This
                approach is ranked 8th in Implicit Emotion Shared Task (IEST) at WASSA2018.

                Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have emerged as a viable solution for text classification, including
                aspect extraction. Yet the existing state-of-the-art CNN architectures used in aspect extraction do not
                incorporate improvements (e.g. non-static CNN, multi-kernel convolution layers, and dropout
                regularization) that have been identified as beneficial for general text classification tasks. In this
                research, we present an improved CNN architecture with these enhancements for aspect extraction. Our
                modifications to the basic CNN model improve feature extraction of the convolutional layer, while
                allowing the dense layers to represent complex non-linear relationships between selected features and
                the output layer. Furthermore, we show that using non-static CNN instead of static CNN further
                fine-tunes the word embedding features for the specific domain of customer reviews in the absence of
                domain-specific corpora to train word2Vec models. We show that using Skip-gram trained word2vec models
                opposed to Continuous bag of word (CBOW) architecture improves the quality of word2vec embedding
                features for aspect extraction and text classification tasks. This new CNN model and baseline CNN are
                evaluated using SemEval-2016 Task 5 Restaurant and Laptop domain datasets. Our CNN model shows
                significant improvements over the baseline CNN model for aspect extraction from customer reviews for
                both restaurant and laptop domains. It also outperforms the currently available state-of-the-art systems
                for restaurant domain.

                This paper describes a system to extract aspect categories for the task of aspect based sentiment
                analysis. This system can extract both implicit and explicit aspects. We propose a one-vs-rest Support
                Vector Machine (SVM) classifier preceded by a state of the art preprocessing pipeline. We present the
                use of mean embeddings as a feature along with two other new features to significantly improve the
                accuracy of the SVM classifier. This solution is extensible to customer reviews in different domains.
                Our results outperform the best recorded F1 score in the SemEval-2016 Task 5 dataset consisting of
                customer reviews from restaurant and laptop domains.
